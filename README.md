# Tavernlight Trial
Answers to the Tavernlight technical trial

Q5: I had some issues with re-creating the disappearing and appearing of the effect as shown in the video. I have also modified the effect.cpp file for OTClient to correctly re-create the effect shown in the video. But the change is committed with question 6 as more changes were made to that file.

Q6: I had some issue with re-creating the red outline on the player when the dash spell is activated. but I had no issue with re-creating the rest by modifying the OTClient code.
